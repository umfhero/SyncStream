# System Tray Icon Fix

## Problem

System tray icon wasn't showing when SyncStream launched. The logs showed:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  pystray not available. System tray will be disabled.
```

## Root Cause

The `pystray` and `win10toast` packages were **not installed** when you first ran SyncStream. These are the packages that enable:

- **pystray**: System tray icon functionality
- **win10toast**: Windows toast notifications

## Solution Applied

### 1. Installed Missing Packages

```bash
pip install pystray win10toast
```

‚úÖ Both packages are now installed and verified working.

### 2. Updated Pre-Flight Check

Modified `check_setup.py` to include these recommended packages in the dependency check:

- **tkinterdnd2** - drag & drop
- **pystray** - system tray icon
- **win10toast** - notifications

Now you'll be warned if these are missing before launch.

## How to Fix Your Current Session

**Simply restart SyncStream!**

The issue is that when SyncStream first started, it checked for pystray at import time and set `SYSTRAY_AVAILABLE = False`. Now that the packages are installed, you just need to:

### Option 1: Run START.bat again

```bash
START.bat
```

### Option 2: Run directly

```bash
python src\syncstream.py
```

## What You Should See Now

When SyncStream starts, you should see:

```
‚úÖ System tray icon initialized
```

Instead of:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  pystray not available. System tray will be disabled.
```

And the system tray icon should appear in your taskbar notification area!

## Verify Installation

Run the pre-flight check to confirm everything is ready:

```bash
python check_setup.py
```

You should see:

```
üì¶ Checking dependencies...
   ‚úÖ customtkinter
   ‚úÖ PIL
   ‚úÖ tkinterdnd2
   ‚úÖ pystray          <-- NEW!
   ‚úÖ win10toast       <-- NEW!
```

## Testing

A test script (`test_systray.py`) was created and successfully verified:

- ‚úÖ pystray imports correctly
- ‚úÖ Icon file loads from Assets/blackp2p.ico
- ‚úÖ System tray icon can be created
- ‚úÖ Menu items can be added

## System Tray Features Available

Once restarted, you'll have access to:

- **Show** - Opens app in normal mode
- **Open in Compact Mode** - Opens in small window mode (NEW!)
- **Hide** - Minimizes to tray
- **Exit** - Closes app completely

## Next Steps

1. **Close the current SyncStream instance** (if running)
2. **Restart SyncStream** using START.bat or python command
3. **Check system tray** (near clock) for SyncStream icon
4. **Right-click the icon** to test the menu

That's it! The system tray should now work perfectly! üéâ
