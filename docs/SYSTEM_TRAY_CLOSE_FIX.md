# System Tray Close Behavior Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Error When Closing App

**Error:**

```
AttributeError: 'Icon' object has no attribute 'is_running'
```

**Cause:**
The code was checking `self.tray_icon.is_running` which doesn't exist in the pystray.Icon object.

**Fix:**
Changed the check from:

```python
if hasattr(self, 'tray_icon') and self.tray_icon and self.tray_icon.is_running:
```

To:

```python
if hasattr(self, 'tray_icon') and self.tray_icon:
```

Now it simply checks if the tray icon exists, which is sufficient.

### 2. ‚ú® Default Tray Action - Opens in Compact Mode

**New Behavior:**

- **Left-click or double-click** system tray icon ‚Üí Opens in **Compact Mode** (small window)
- Right-click for menu with other options

**Menu Structure (Updated):**

```
üñ±Ô∏è Open in Compact Mode  ‚Üê DEFAULT (left/double-click)
   Show in Normal Mode
   Hide
   ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
   Exit
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/ui/main_window.py`

**1. Fixed `_on_window_close()` method:**

- Removed invalid `is_running` check
