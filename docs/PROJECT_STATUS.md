# SyncStream - Project Setup Complete! 🎉

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Project Foundation

1. **Complete project structure** created with organized folders:

   - `/src` - Main application code
     - `/core` - Core functionality (network, file management, config)
     - `/ui` - User interface components
     - `/utils` - Utility functions
   - `/config` - Configuration templates
   - `/docs` - Documentation
   - `/Assets` - Icons (already had p2p.ico and p2p.png)

2. **Configuration System** implemented:

   - `profiles.json.template` - Secure profile template (NOT committed to git)
   - `.gitignore` - Protects private IP addresses and sensitive data
   - `config_manager.py` - Complete configuration management system
   - Pre-configured with Majid and Nathan profiles as examples

3. **Documentation** created:

   - `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation with features
   - `TODO.md` - Detailed development roadmap
   - `QUICKSTART.md` - Easy setup guide for new users
   - Clear instructions for profile configuration

4. **Dependencies** defined:
   - `requirements.txt` - All Python dependencies listed
   - CustomTkinter for modern UI
   - TkinterDnD2 for drag-and-drop
   - Pillow for thumbnails
   - pystray for system tray
   - win10toast for notifications

## 📋 Understanding Your Requirements

Based on your detailed requirements, here's what SyncStream will include:

### 🔐 Security & Privacy (Requirement 1)

- ✅ Profile system uses JSON file (NOT in git)
- ✅ Pre-configured with Majid/Nathan examples but easy to customize
- ✅ Auto-remembers last connection
- ✅ Auto-reconnects to last peer on startup

### 🌐 Connection Management (Requirement 2)

- LED status indicators: 🔴 Red (disconnected) → 🟠 Orange (connecting) → 🟢 Green (connected)
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- 2-3 minute timeout before giving up
- "Try Connecting" button to restart attempts

### 📁 File Transfer Features (Requirement 3)

- Drag-and-drop as primary method
- File browser button as alternative
- Auto-zip folders/unsupported files
- Progress bars for all transfers
- "Sent" marker after completion
- Multiple simultaneous transfers
- Visual checklist for transfer status

### 🖼️ File Gallery (Requirement 4)

- Grid layout with responsive thumbnails
- Actions: Open, Delete, Re-send, Save As, Download
- Search with autocomplete suggestions
- Filters: by user, by data type (mp4, png, jpg, etc.)
- Metadata: thumbnail, name, size always visible

### 🎨 UI/UX Design (Requirement 5)

- Shared window for sent/received files
- System tray icon (always running)
- Quick open and send
- Auto-queue when disconnected, auto-send when connected
- Notifications for incoming files
- Theme toggle (light/dark) with persistence
- Scalable window (default: 60% fullscreen)
- Compact mode (<30% screen) - only drag-drop + essential features

### 💾 Data Management (Requirement 6)

- Files in `%APPDATA%/SyncStream/` by default
- Custom download location option
- Transfer history/logs saved
- Metadata/config persistence
- Shows past sent/received on app open

### ⚡ Advanced Features (Requirement 7)

- No encryption (relies on Tailscale)
- Optional file compression (off by default)
- Auto-zip unzipped folders
- Send zipped folders allowed
- Network statistics (total data, per-user data)

### 🛠️ Error Handling (Requirement 8)

- 3 retry attempts on network disconnect
- User notification after failed attempts
- Tailscale-specific error detection
- System notifications for errors
- Clear error messages explaining issues

## 🎯 Next Steps

The foundation is solid! Here's what comes next:

### Immediate Priority (Phase 2):

1. **Network Manager** (`network_manager.py`)

   - TCP socket handling
   - Connection state machine
   - Auto-reconnect logic
   - Status callbacks

2. **File Transfer Protocol** (`transfer_protocol.py`)

   - Protocol design
   - Chunked transfers
   - Progress tracking
   - Queue management

3. **File Manager** (`file_manager.py`)
   - File operations
   - Thumbnail generation
   - History tracking
   - Auto-zip functionality

### Then (Phase 3):

4. **Theme System** (`theme_manager.py`)

   - Light/dark themes per design brief
   - Toggle functionality

5. **Main UI Window** (`main_window.py`)

   - Connection LED
   - Profile selectors
   - File gallery
   - Drag-drop zone

6. **File Gallery** (`file_gallery.py`)
   - Grid layout
   - Search/filters
   - Context menus

## 🚀 Ready to Start Coding!

Everything is set up and documented. The `config_manager.py` is fully functional and tested.

### To test the config manager:

```bash
cd src/core
python config_manager.py
```

### To get started with development:

1. Check `TODO.md` for the full roadmap
2. Follow the phases in order
3. Each module is clearly defined
4. Reference the old Vortext Tunnel code when needed

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture** - Separated concerns (core, UI, utils)
2. **Security First** - profiles.json not tracked in git
3. **User-Friendly** - Clear documentation and quick start guide
4. **Extensible** - Easy to add features later
5. **Type Safety** - Using dataclasses for configuration
6. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error messages throughout

## 📞 Questions or Clarifications?

If you need any clarification on:

- How to structure a specific module
- Best practices for implementation
- Integration between components
- Testing strategies

Just ask! The foundation is solid, and we can start building the core functionality.
